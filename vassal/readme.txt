Getting Started
1. Log in and choose a side. (Paneuropean or Combine). 
2. Choose to play either the Ogre or the defender. Defender sets up first.
-Basic Game: Attacker has a Ogre Mark III, and enters at bottom of map. Defender has 12 SP of armor (Howitzers count double) and 20 SP of infantry, plus 1 command post. All but 20 SP must set up on or behind the line drawn between the two crater hexes at the map edges.
-Advanced Game: Attacker has a Ogre Mark V, and enters at bottom of map. Defender has 20 SP of armor (Howitzers count double) and 30 SP of infantry, plus 1 command post. All but 40 SP must set up on or behind the line drawn between the two crater hexes at the map edges.

Using the Toolbar
The module toolbar includes these buttons:
Undo: undoes the last move.
Step: steps through an email log.
Connect: connects to the Vassal server.
Retire: join another side in the game.
Units: access the units palette.
Dice: rolls 1 six sided die.
Turns: tracks current game turn/phase. Click Ctrl+Space to advance the current phase. (At game start, the sequence will include optional movement phases for GEVs. If no GEVs are being used by either side, you can remove these from the turn sequence to speed up play. Right-click the Turn tracker and pick Configure. Deselect one or both unused GEV movement phases, and then click OK.)
Charts: shows the Ogre CRT.
Range: click to draw a rangefinder line between any two hexes.
Zoom: re-scales the map.

Command Menus
Each piece includes the following right-click command menu items:
Disable (armor units only): marks the unit as Disabled. Disabled units cannot move or fire until your next turn. Disabled units are restored to normal status at the end of the enemy's next Fire phase. 
Reduce (infantry only): reduces the infantry unit strength by 1. (An infantry unit at strength 1 may only be destroyed.)
Systems (Ogres only): access the Ogre's control panel for marking damage to Ogre systems. Tick boxes off as weapons or treads are destroyed, or as missiles are fired. Ogres begin with a Move 3 and are reduced to the indicated move level as Treads are destroyed. When all tread units are destroyed, the Ogre cannot move.
Destroy: removes the unit from the game.

Optional Rules
Optional rules (mines and camouflage) are not supported.
